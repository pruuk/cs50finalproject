# Welcome to Homeworld Gaius!

This is a demo Multi User Dungeon (MUD) built on top of the Evennia codebase. It is primarily written in
Python. This will be the final project for Harvard's CS50 course for both Calabe Davis and Malia Ambata.
Calabe will focus on the Python code that controls in game objects, scripts, actions, etc. Malia will be
focusing on updating the web portal by adding user engagement and functionality. Both Calabe and Malia will write the game story content.

Homeworld Gaius will be a MUD based in a world that is slightly smaller than Earth with three moons that
are roughly the same size. The technology level for this world will be roughly equivalent to Roman times.

We will host the MUD so it can be logged into soon. URL TBD.
