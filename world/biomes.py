"""
Biomes Handler file.
This file will contain the functions and containers for handling room
biomes. Generally, the map symbol set for a room should match the primary
biome type of the room, except when the room has a major road running
through it or the room is indoors.
Biome types will affect climate/weather, but will also be affected by other
factors such as elevation, time of year, climate/weather, the actions of
mobile characters & NPCs, etc.
Biomes are for use in outdoor rooms. Indoor rooms will just have objects
and status effects.
