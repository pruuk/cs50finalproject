"""
Dice roller is a bit of a misnomer in this case because we are generating
random numbers from a distribution rather than a dice roll so that results will
be crowded closer to the mean, reducing the randomness of normal dice style
random generators for action checks.

There will be two types of dice rollers:
One that returns a value without the posibility of re-rolling because of a crit
and one that allows for crits to tack on additional value, but at a diminishing
return for each subsequent 'critical' roll.

A critical roll will be anything more than two standard deviations outside the
normal for that roller. The function for rolling with crits will need more info
passed in because we are controlling character progression/chances to learn
based upon critcal successes and failures (on the theory that we learn our
trimpuphs and our fuckups). The roller that allows criticals will also have a
few different options for randomness (flattened, normal, and steep). Flattened
distributions will have more variance (be more random in a sense), normal
distributions will look like a bell curve, and steep distributions will have
a smaller deviation from mu.

Critical successes and failures will be stored as extra info on skills (stored
inside a traits type) and then cleared when that skill 'levels up'. See the
progression handler for more details.

    higher than 100 for exceptionally skilled or talented individuals. For
    example, someone that powerlifts might have a strength score approaching
